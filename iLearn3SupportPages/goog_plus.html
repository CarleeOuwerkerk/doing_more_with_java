<h1 class="centered">Setup Accounts</h1>
<p>
In this step, you will learn about the tools used in this course and get them set up. In addition to becoming generally familiar with the tools and how they will be used, be sure to complete the specific tasks listed below before moving on. 
</p>
<p>Once you have completed everything listed for you to do here, you will have:</p>
<ol>
	<li>signed up for a Google account,</li>
	<li>signed up for Google+,</li>
	<li>used Hangouts and Hangouts on Air to record a video introducing yourself,</li>
	<li>joined the class Community,</li>
	<li>shared your introduction video to the class Community, and</li>
	<li>signed up for a Github account.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Google Accounts and Tools</h3>
<p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			If you do not already have one, create an account with <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail">Google</a>. A googlele account includes a Gmail (email) address that is used as your login for all Google tools used in this course.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<a href="https://plus.google.com/">Set up a Google+ account</a> if you don't already have one. Google+ is a networking site that you use to collaborate with your Instructor and team. To make this possible, you will become part of a Google+ Community that includes your teammates and your instructor. You will also become part of a Google+ Community that includes all of your other classmates.
		</p>
		<p>
			After your instructor assigns you to a team, one team member will need to set up a Community for the team and invite the other tean members to join. Use this team Community for all your team communications. You can use links to your comments in your community as evidence of your professionalism (See <span class="bookTitle">How to be successful in this Class</span> for more information about assessments). To see how the instructor will assess your professionalism look at the course rubric.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Google Calendar is what you will use to schedule all of your meetings with your teammates. Google Calendar provides a convenient way to share your team meeting schedule with your team. When you create your Google account you already have access to google Calendar. Google has produced <a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/2465776?hl=en">a quick help to get you started with Google Calendar</a>.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<a href="https://hangouts.google.com">Google Hangouts</a> makes it possible for you to video conference with your team and record the meetings. When you submit a request for assessment with your instructor (See <span class="bookTitle">How to be successful in this Class</span> for more information about assessments) you can add a link to the recorded meeting on youtube and a timestamp that allows your instructor to immediately see you being professional in the recorded team meeting. To see how the instructor will assess your professionalism look at the course rubric.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Hangout Hints</h4>Once you start your first Hangout, be sure to explore the apps available to you and your team. For example, during a hangout you can access your Google Drive files, share a whiteboard, allow team members to view your screen, etc. Hangouts are broadcast and recorded using the Hangouts on Air (HOA) function. This requires that you have a YouTube account. There is a short setup and verification process the first time you host an HOA. Once the HOA is complete the recording will automatically post to your YouTube account. You can then share the recording to your team’s Community so that it is easily accessible for your instructor and other team members.

			BYU-Idaho has produced <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/7931ca5d-1b7b-4773-965a-7880c55338a2/1/HoA.zip/story.html">a video that helps you learn to use Hangouts on Air</a>. Follow the steps there to see how to setup and use Hangouts on Air. Google has produced <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/2553119?hl=en">a quick help to get you started with Hangouts on Air</a>.

		<p>
			Google+ Communities are designed as a virtual space for people to gather around a specific topic. In this case, the topic will be this class. All of the interactions you have with your team, the instructor, and the rest of the class can an should be done through the community. By using the community to communicate, all the other members of the community can draw strength and learn from your interactions just as you can from their's.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your instructor will post advice, tips, tricks, etc. to the Community that relate to the entire class. You can post technical questions to the class community to help you resolve issues or get help with technical questions. You can also express your professionalism by answering questions others have, both in and outside your team. You can then add links to your knowledge sharing postings when you request an assessment (See <span class="bookTitle">How to be successful in this Class</span> for more information about assessments).
		</p>
		<p>
			Your instructor will assign you to be part of a team for this course. (Don't worry. No team grades will be given; only individual grades.) After you are notified who is on your team, you or one of your teammates will need to create a Google+ Community for your team. The other teammates will need to join the team community. Google has produced <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/2872671?hl=en">a quick help to get you started creating and joining Google Communities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your instructor will create a Google+ Community for the entire class and let you know what it is. You will need to join that community too.
		</p>

	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			After all of this is in place, create an introduction video using Hangouts on Air. You won't need to invite anyone else to your hangout. Quickly introduce yourself to the class and post your introduction to the class community.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> account will be needed for this course. It allows your team to share and work on code together. It requires some learning, but is much better than using Google drive or something like dropbox. When you request an assessment from the instructor (See <span class="bookTitle">How to be successful in this Class</span> for more information about assessments) you can include links directly to the code for the technologies you are claiming fluency in.
		</p>
		<p>
			Claiming fluency is not the only time you may want to share a link to your code on GitHub. When you have a question about how some of your code works or why it isn't working, a link in a posting to the community allows your instructor, your team, and the class as a whole to help you. When you ask for help in this way, you are also helping the other students express their professionalism so they can point to the professional sharing they have done with you when they claim their fluency(See <span class="bookTitle">How to be successful in this Class</span> for more information about assessments).
		</p>
		<p>
			Sign up for a <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> account. To make it possible for your instructor to identify you, your username needs to be in this format: Last Name-First Name. If you already have a GitHub account set up previously, you will need to either change the username for that account or create a new GitHub account to match the required username format. If this username has already been taken, please pick a variation of this format. For example, you might simply add “1234” to the end of your username.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are multiple GitHub GUI apps for you to choose between to ease your interactions, or you can learn the git command line tool. It enables you to interact with GitHub in a more powerful and industry standard way.
