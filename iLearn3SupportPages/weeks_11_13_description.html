	<h1>Weeks 11 - 13</h1>
	<h3>Working Professionally</h3>
	<p>
		In these weeks you will continue to work to the plan you created with your team. If you have been assessed at a 'Disagree' level of fluency in all the technical areas of the course before the beginning of week 11, you and your team can work to your team plan to achieve fluency assessments of 'Agree' or 'Strongly Agree'. If you haven't been assessed as having a 'Disagree' level of fluency in all the tech, continue working towards that goal.

		Detailed information about how to achieve 'Agree' or 'Strongly Agree' fluency assessments is available in the <span class="bold">Course module</span>. Please look there for specifics.
