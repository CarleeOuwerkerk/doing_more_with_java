<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>CIT 360 Syllabus </strong></h3>
<h2>COURSE STRUCTURE</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
This course is designed to begin to help you acquire the technical and professionalism skills required to develop applications in the current work environment. Because of this, the course focuses on how to solve larger, ill-structured problems using Java and the Android Software Developer Kit (SDK).
<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
By taking advantage of opportunities this course provides, you will become more professional by:
<ul>
	<li>becoming fluent in the concepts found in <a title="Topics and Resources" href="http://barneyooii.wordpress.com/cases/">a list of Java topics</a> and designing, testing, and creating an Android client and a Java enterprise server,</li>
	<li>becoming more aware of the entirety of the software development process in addition to the development component,</li>
	<li>becoming a learner that embodies the BYU-Idaho learning model. This includes, but is not limited to individual preparation, teaching others, and pondering,</li>
	<li>becoming more open to ideas of others,</li>
	<li>becoming more self-reliant in your learning,</li>
	<li>becoming more productive and empathetical in team environments,</li>
	<li>becoming more productive and appropriate in your communication with team members, managers, and mentors,</li>
	<li>becoming more aware of the impact of your decisions on team members and others,</li>
	<li>becoming more aware of your own thought processes, attitudes, and biases through self-reflection and meta-cognition,</li>
	<li>becoming more analytical in making and defending decisions, and</li>
	<li>becoming more creative through exploring and applying the concepts found in <a title="Topics and Resources" href="http://barneyooii.wordpress.com/cases/">the list of Java topics</a> associated with this course in interesting ways.</li>
</ul>
(Hint: A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABy4jwG7j78fslshPa2Fv-AfTW1-fmZRaziT57r1OBs">Google sheet grading template</a> is available for you track your grade and see how it is calculated.)

These outcomes support both <a href="https://barneyhybrid.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/universityandcitoutcomes.pdf">the CIT Department and BYU-Idaho student learning outcomes.</a>

The assignments and assessments for this course are designed to give you opportunities to achieve these outcomes and assess you against them. If you desire a different set of assessments and assignments, you may propose them (during the first or second week of the semester) to the instructor but your proposal must cover ALL of the objectives in significant ways and to a significant depth. Do not propose a "check list" of do-once and forget activities. These will not be approved.
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
CIT 260 - It is expected that you have learned and remember the information made available to you in this course. If you do not, you will need to remediate yourself and relearn what you have forgotten or didn't learn. This will make your experience in this course more difficult--dramatically increasing the amount of time you will need in order to do well. The instructor will do what he can to aid you in your remediation but do not expect a "review" to be done at the beginning of the course. There is not enough time to review an entire semester's worth of learning.
<h2>COURSE OVERVIEW</h2>
This course is designed to allow you to become more professional by experiencing an environment where the instructor is your professional mentor. Using Java, Android Java, UML, and other tools you will learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to problems that have many 'right' solutions through creating an Android app and Java server for that app. Having had such a mentored learning experience is very important when you begin your career.

You will be working in groups but responsible for your own learning. This is accomplished when I evaluate your learning, not the team’s. To accomplish this, assessment points have been created in the course. These consist of visits to my office to claim fluency and professionalism as described in the google sheet referenced from the <a href="https://barneyooii.wordpress.com/course-information/rubrics/">Assignments and Assessments</a> portion of this blog.

<h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
<h3>Prepare:</h3>
Each week you will work directly with your team outside of class time. You help your team become successful if you come prepared for these team meetings. You should come having thought about the design of your project, completed assignments given during the previous meeting, and having done the necessary research to plan the next steps for your group. Just as in life, if you do more than fulfill minimum requirements assigned to you, you will be more successful in your team and in the class. Magnify your professional calling.
<h3>Teach One Another:</h3>
Team meetings and a collaborative environment have been established to enable each of you to draw from the strengths of others so that your weaknesses can become strengths. This requires effort on the part of both the knower and the learner ‘so that both may be edified.’
<h3>Ponder/Prove:</h3>
Pondering is integral to success in both this course and life. You should be pondering and reflecting and then recording this self-reflection in a journal. Record this reflection at least weekly so that you have information to work with when you create your journal report at the end of the semester. You will also need to post weekly self-reflective ponderings for other class members to see.

Proving is also integral to success. You should prove what you think you know through experimentation. Just finding an example of some principle on the web or from your team is insufficient for successful learning. You should be playing with and generating your own examples to understand how technologies work and what they do. This way you become a blessing to yourself and your current and future team members.
<h2>Required Materials and Tools:</h2>
It is required that you use the tools listed below as you work with your team. These tools were selected because they provide a simple way for you to collaborate with your team, your instructor and the entire class.
<ul>
	<li>GitHub, and</li>
	<li>An Android development environment</li>
</ul>
<h2>GRADING POLICIES</h2>
<h3>Course Assessments</h3>
Your grade in this course will be based on the assessments in the table below. See the Rubrics for details about expectations for each assessment.

By your continual interactions with me and through observing your continual interactions with your team and classmates, I will develop an understanding of your fluency and how to help you increase it. This understanding will be much better than any test or quiz could provide. To this end, you will should try to meet with me every other week. These biweekly meetings are your opportunity to provide direct evidence of your fluency in the course topics and your professionalism.
<h3>Biweekly Meetings</h3>
You must come having created and shared with me, in class, concrete evidences of your fluency. You must have created this evidence, not your team, a tutor, a previous student, the internet, or any other person or source. In this <strong>10 minute</strong> meeting you will declare the one or more topics for which you have previously provided evidence in class and then proceed to be assessed based on your classroom and other interactions with me. <em><strong>This is not a slide presentation.</strong></em> Specifically, I will be recording your fluency based on classroom observations. I will determine if you know and understand how to use the topic, what options the topic gives you when coding and designing, you are using and understanding the topic correctly, and you can fully explain the topic fluently and well. After being assessed, you can, if you desire, spend additional time further developing fluency and then provide more evidence on that topic in class. This recursive process is used for assessing both the coding and the diagram fluency.
<h3>Overall Course Grade</h3>
These grade requirement descriptions come directly from the university's catalog.

• “A” represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.

• “B” represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.

• “C” represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.

• “D” represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.

• “F” represents failure in the course

Your overall course grade will be based on the following scale:
