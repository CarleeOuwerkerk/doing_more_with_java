You will be working in groups but responsible for your own learning. This is accomplished whe' your learning, not the team's is evaluated. To accomplish this, assessment points have been created in the course. These consist of providing evidence of your fluency in the technologies in the form of sandbox code, UML diagrams, and code you, not your team, have written. Additional evidence of professionalism is required. You can see what these are and how your fluency and professionalism will be assessed by viewing the course rubric.
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
By taking advantage of opportunities this course provides, you will become more professional by:
<ul>
	<li>becoming more professional as a protog&eacute; and a mentor,</li>
	<li>becoming more self-reliant in scheduling and meeting due dates you set for yourself and that are negotiated with team members,</li>
	<li>becoming more productive and empathetical in team environments,</li>
	<li>becoming more productive and appropriate in your communication with team members, managers, and mentors,</li>
	<li>becoming more aware of the impact of your decisions on team members and others,</li>
	<li>becoming more aware of your own thought processes, attitudes, and biases through self-reflection and meta-cognition,</li>
	<li>becoming more open to ideas of others,</li>
	<li>becoming more self-reliant in your learning,</li>
	<li>becoming more analytical in making and defending decisions,</li>
	<li>becoming more of a learner that embodies the BYU-Idaho learning model. This includes, but is not limited to individual preparation, teaching others, and pondering,</li>
	<li>becoming more aware of the entirety of the software development process in addition to the development component,</li>
	<li>becoming more fluent in the concepts found in a select list of Java topics and designing, testing, and creating an Android client and a Java enterprise server, and</li>
	<li>becoming more creative through exploring and applying, in interesting ways, the concepts found in the list of Java topics.</li>
</ul>

These outcomes support both <a href="universityandcitoutcomes.pdf">the CIT Department and BYU-Idaho student learning outcomes.</a>

The assignments and assessments for this course are designed to give you opportunities to achieve these outcomes and assess you against them. If you desire a different set of assessments and assignments, you may propose them (during the first or second week of the semester) to the instructor but your proposal must cover ALL of the objectives in significant ways and to a significant depth. Do not propose a "check list" of do-once and forget activities. These will not be approved.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
CIT 260 - It is expected that you have learned and remember the information made available to you in this CIT 260. If you do not, you will need to remediate yourself and relearn what you have forgotten or didn't learn. This will make your experience in this course more difficult--dramatically increasing the amount of time you will need in order to do well. The instructor will do what he can to aid you in your remediation but do not expect a "review" to be done at the beginning of the course. There is not enough time to review an entire semester's worth of learning.

<h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
<h3>Prepare:</h3>
Each week you will work directly with your team outside of class time. You help your team become successful if you come prepared for these team meetings. You should come having thought about the design of your project, completed assignments given during the previous meeting, and having done the necessary research to plan the next steps for your group. Just as in life, if you do more than fulfill minimum requirements assigned to you, you will be more successful in your team and in the class. Magnify your professional calling.
<h3>Teach One Another:</h3>
Team meetings and a collaborative environment have been established to enable each of you to draw from the strengths of others so that your weaknesses can become strengths. This requires effort on the part of both the knower and the learner 'so that both may be edified.'
<h3>Ponder/Prove:</h3>
Pondering is integral to success in both this course and life. You should be pondering and reflecting and then recording this self-reflection in a journal. Record this reflection at least weekly so that you have information to work with when you create your journal report at the end of the semester. You will also need to post weekly self-reflective ponderings for other class members to see.

Proving is also integral to success. You should prove what you think you know through experimentation. Just finding an example of some principle on the web or from your team is insufficient for successful learning. You should be playing with and generating your own examples to understand how technologies work and what they do. This way you become a blessing to yourself and your current and future team members.

<h3>From the University Catalog:</h3>
<ul> 
<li>"A" represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.</li>

<li>"B" represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.</li>

<li>"C" represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.</li>

<li>"D" represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.</li>

<li>"F" represents failure in the course.</li>
</ul>
