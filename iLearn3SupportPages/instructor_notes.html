<h2>General Course Overview</h2>
<p>This software development course is designed to help students start acquiring the technical and professional attitudes and skills required to develop quality <span id="specific_language_description"></span>. Because of this, they will learn new ways of applying the technologies they already know and learn new technologies as they apply agile development methods. Students reflect on their experience throughout the course through journaling, documenting their growth as it relates to the course outcomes, and a final journal report. See the syllabus and the assignment descriptions below for more details.</p>

<h2>Purpose for Design Decisions</h2>
<p>As communicated through the course outcomes, this course professionalism and learning software development skills in addition to achieving fluency in the courses technical components.</p>
<p>It is important that students understand why the course is designed the way it is and what we’re trying to accomplish. Please direct students to the links in the Course iLearn 3 module as you answer questions whenever possible. Please answer questions, encourage students, provide feedback, and help students prepare for upcoming due dates by posting links you feel are applicable to the team and class communities as needed.</p>
<h2>Tools Used in This Course</h2>
<p>Google+*  and GitHub have been selected as the collaboration platforms for this course. Within Google+, students will create a team community to which you will have access. Students will also belong to a class community which you set up each semester and maintain. Please see the Setting up Google+ and gitHub link in the Course iLearn 3 module for a more complete description of how to setup and use each tool. The intention is that these tools will provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a space for informal collaboration among team members (asking each other questions, answering questions, posting resources etc.),</li>
  <li>a way for students to provide evidence of professionalism as described in the course rubric,</li>
  <li>a place for team members to collaborate on the actual code for their project,</li>
  <li>an experience with tools that students will likely use in their future employment, and</li>
  <li>a place for the instructor to share examples with the students. For example if you create an example during office hours for the class and save that code into a repository in GitHub for future reference by the students.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be familiar with the creation of Google+ communities and using git and gitHub since you will need to answer student questions. Please note that the Online Support Center is not equipped to help students with Google+ or GitHub as it is used in this course. While the steps outlined in the Setting Up Google+ link are complete. You are the one that must be prepared to assist your students.</p>
<p>Students are instructed to make you the owner of the Google+ team communities they set up. This will allow you to handle changes to team members if necessary.</p>
<p>The team community is designed as the single place where students can store evidence of their growing professionalism. A community that has been properly set up and is active will include;</p>
<ul>
  <li>informal communication between team members including yourself,</li>
  <li>recordings of team meetings posted to the community feed by students.</li>
  <li>links to the students’ GitHub repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h4>*Google+ includes the use of Docs, Hangouts, Hangouts on Air, Events and Communities.</h4>

<h2>The Google+ Class Community</h2>
<p>The class community is set up and maintained by you. A major purpose of the class community is for students to have an opportunity to professionally share what they are learning regarding the technologies, course structure, and course expectations.</p>
<p>Use the class community to communicate course-wide issues. You could, for example, post reminders about an upcoming deadline, address common misunderstandings regarding the course, etc. In making these announcements, remember that you may have students joining the class late so they will miss out on announcements posted in the class community until they are able to join. Don’t assume new students have seen what you have posted in the past.</p>

<h2>The Instructor's Role</h2>
<p>You will get a lot of, "what should I do" kinds of questions. Your role is to mentor students through those questions. Be careful not to be too explicit. Be an assistant, not a guide that the students fall in line behind. The instructor should be like Christ - he aids us as we mess up and repent. He could keep us from making mistakes like Satan suggested, but He doesn't because He wants us to become, not just follow. Sometimes Christ tells us explicitly what to do, but these instances are rare.</p>
<p>Communicate to the students something like “It would be bad for me to tell you what to do. My job is to guide you in accomplishing what YOU want to do, not tell you what to do. Wrestle with ambiguity.” We aren't only trying to help them become more fluent in the tech...we're trying to help them become more professional by encouraging agency. Part of professionalism is to realize we are each responsible for our own learning goals and outcomes.</p>
<p>Gentle reminders to do their self-reflective journaling should be given periodically during the semester. This will yield much better journal reports at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>You are NOT to grade code. Grades are to be assessments of fluency and professionalism evidences provided by the students. To see what is expected, examine the contents of the links in the Course iLearn 3 module. You can also post questions to the SoftwareDev Courses Google+ community maintained by Bro. Barney. This is the preferred communication vehicle for all instructors of this course.</p>

<h2>Groups/Teams</h2>
<p>Students are organized into teams of 3 (preferable) or 4 (if necessary). You should organize these teams on Monday morning of week 2. Communicate with the students via their gmail address regarding which team they belong to so THEY can setup their team Google+ community. Make sure they include you in this community.</p>

<h2>Due Dates</h2>
<p>Add deadlines for submission are on Saturdays at 11:59 PM in their time zone. By the end of week 10 students must have submitted their evidences for a Disagree fluency level in the technologies if they want to eventually attempt fluency levels of Agree or Strongly Agree. If they have not met the week 10 deadline for ALL the technologies, they can not be assess higher for than Disagree for any technology. They can, through continued work through the remainder of the semester, achieve Disagree fluencies for the technologies and continue to provide professionalism evidences. Thus a student may end up in a situation where the are assessed at Disagree for all the technologies and Strongly Agree for their professionalism assessments. This is not uncommon and results in a passing grade for the student.</p>
<p>By the end of week 13 those students who can and wish to be assessed at Agree or Strongly Agree levels must have submitted all of their additional evidences. You should encourage students to not wait until the end of week 13 to do their submissions. Encourage them to submit early so if they don’t achieve Strongly Agree they can attempt to gain additional fluency. Do NOT slip this deadline. Do NOT accept fluency evidence after the end of week 13.</p>
<p>The deadline for submitting the journal report is the end of week 14.</p>

<h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
<p>Students should complete their work on time. Do not extend due dates or deadlines.</p>

<h2>Weekly Tasks</h2>
<p>You should do the following each week in addition to the tasks identified throughout the remainder of this document.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Participate in the class and team communities. This means answering appropriate questions, mentoring, encouraging, directing students where they might look to find answers, etc. This class is designed to free up the majority of your time for this activity.</li>
  <li>Review fluency claims evidences. These should be formatted like and similar to the fluency claim examples in the How to be Successful in the Class link of the Course iLearn 3 module.</li>
  <li>Look for opportunities to help your students. This might mean posting audio clips to the class community about technologies, or remind/explain to the class in a post how to be more successful in the class.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Introduction Week</h2>
<p>The students are entering a course that is culturally different than courses they may have had before. Your job during the first week is to help them begin making the needed cultural change. Make sure that you are making multiple contacts with the students during this week through the team community.</p>
<p>You will also receive student questions regarding what is to be done for the course. Be ready to answer those not only with references to the documents that make up the Course iLearn 3 module, but also with statements to help calm the students. Many students feel lost at sea since there is not a list of specific assignments to complete.</p>
<p>You will also want to strongly encourage the students to begin exploring, at a high, understanding level, the topics found in the Rubric and What if Sheet. Remind them that they will need to have some understanding of what these technical topics are, not how they work, in order to help their team layout their learning schedule based on the agile development methodology the team selects.</p>
<h3>Specific Tasks for the Introduction Week</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Personalize and then send out the welcome email to all students in the class. Have the students respond to this email and include their gmail address so you can add them to the class community.</li>
  <li>Respond to students and help them feel welcome in the class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think, Design, Create is the development process taught in this course. Test is currently left out. If you feel that test is a needed component feel free to add it. Do not do this via unit tests. Other testing such as system-level testing may be appropriate to include.</p>
<p>It is important that you help students follow this development process and see how it matches up with the agile development methodology they have selected as a team. You may need to help them realize that you can’t design and create something if you don’t understand how the components work.</p>
<p>There will be students that don’t believe the thinking and designing steps are necessary. They may think that they can begin with writing code (Create) immediately. Make sure that when they ask you questions you inquire about their thinking and designing. If they have not done those steps refer them back to them without answering their question. If you do not do this the students will continue using the “create first” approach.</p>
<p>Remind students that if they want to achieve Agree or Strongly Agree fluency assessments, they, as individuals or teams, must use the technologies in a DESIGNED application. Also tell them that they must have presented their app design to you, got feedback from you on the design, and made all the the design changes you’ve suggested BEFORE they can write code.</p>
<p>Students are to have this design interaction with you as part of the class community, not as part of a fluency claim assessment. Your feedback should be framed as supportive, not critical. This is not grading. It is feedback for them to hone their ideas before they begin coding.</p>
<h2>Fluency Claims</h2>
<p>Encourage students to make fluency claims every other week, with the first being in week 3. Make sure any feedback you give is valuable; not just pats on the back. Treat the students as professionals. Give them a performance review as if you were their line boss. They will need feedback on how to better interact with their team, their understanding of the process and the topics, and the rate at which they are achieving fluency. Make it meaty but pleasant. Substantial feedback should be posted in the feedback field of each fluency claim in I-Learn in place of the usual verbal feedback that would be provided during a face-to-face interview. Point to specific things they did well and/or could improve on.</p>
<h3>Examples of Substantial Feedback</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“I could tell from your 3/15 meeting (1:15 – 2:10) that you were very prepared. You had clearly researched the topic and…”</li>
  <li>“Your post (link to post) was really helpful. I could tell Jacob was struggling to understand this coding issue and the resource you pointed him to is exactly where I would have sent him.”</li>
  <li>“I noticed you did not participate a lot during the 3/17 team meeting. It looked like you weren’t prepared to report on your assignment. What issues are you having that are preventing you from fully participating?”</li>
  <li>“I think you may run into problems in line 218 of your code. What alternatives have you considered? Please make this an agenda item for your next team meeting.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for Dealing with Fluency Claims</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You should be interacting regularly with students and teams before they make a fluency claim. This enables you to have a pretty good sense of each student’s fluency. Think of the fluency claim as an ongoing part of the course and not something that happens every couple of weeks. You may want to consider keeping running notes on each student so that providing feedback is simple and straightforward.</li>
    <li>You can search for the name of a specific student in a community and it displays only their postings.</li>
    <li>It is not expected that you watch the recordings of the team meetings in their entirety. Instead, students must post links to their team meetings and include timestamps of when they are teaching their team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Reflective/Meta-Cognative Journal Report</h2>
<p>Journal reports are due during the final week of class.</p>
<p>Give students periodic reminders that their journal entries are private and that they should be deep, rich, and reflective; how they have changed or not changed. They are not to be what they have done or the technologies they have learned.</p>

<h2>Course Conclusion Week</h2>
<p>There is only one item to grade this week, the journal reports. Students will submit their report through iLearn. See the course rubric for how to assess the report.</p>
