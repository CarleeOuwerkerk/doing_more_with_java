	<h1>Weeks 3 - 10</h1>
	<h3>Working Consistantly and Professionally</h3>
	<p>
		In these weeks you will work to the plan you created with your team. Remember, professionals do not ignore dates they have committed to. If you are unable to meet a commitment date work with your team to update your team's schedule. Do not ignore a commitment date. 

		Detailed information about what you need to achieve in these weeks is available in the <span class="bold">Course module</span>. Please look there for specifics about the end of week 10 and what you will be doing in weeks 11 - 13.
