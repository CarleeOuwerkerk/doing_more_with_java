<h1 class="centered">How Much Time?</h1>
<p>
Not everyone will need the same amount of time to be successful in this class. Some will need more time than others. This tool is designed to help you figure out how much time you will need to reserve out of your busy weeks for this class.
</p>
<p>
To use it, you will first need to honestly self-assess your preparation for CIT 360. Read the descriptions for the preparation levels below. In order to claim preparation at any level, the statements for all lower levels must also be true. For example, if you claim a preparation level of 4 the descriptions for levels 3,2,and 1 must also be true. It is vital to your ability to mangage your time that you select your true level of preperation.
</p>
Your instructor will never ask for nor see your preparedness selections. Do not try to deceive yourself. It is better to select something that feels a little too low than to stretch your claim to a higher level.
<h3>Preparedness Self-Assessment Levels</h3>
<ol>
	<li>I can read code</li>
	<li>I can write code for loops, arrays, and methods when given line-by-line guidance</li>
	<li>I can recite what an Instance is and what a class is for</li>
	<li>I can imagine and correctly implement Java class code to represent concrete types of objects such as dogs, trees, etc. and correctly use local variables, parameters, and class attributes</li>
	<li>I can correctly implement multi-level inheritance of non-concrete objects, such as an Idea class, using Java classes and correctly apply super-classes and interfaces</li>
	<li>I can find a real-life need others have, imagine and create an application design, and then write the code for the full application</li>
</ol>
</p>Now that you have honestly selected your level of preperation for CIT 360, decide what grade you want to achieve. Find the grade you want to achieve in the first column and your preparation level in the first row of table below. The intersection of the grade row with the preparation level column contains the approximate weekly hours you need to reserve in your schedule to achieve your grade goal for CIT 360. 
</p>
<p>
If you are in a face-to-face class this number of hours includes in-class and out-of-class time. If you are in an online class it shows you the total time you will need to dedicate out of your weekly schedule. These numbers are only approximations. They assume you are using the hours at a high degree of efficiency.
</p>
<p>
While these numbers are approximate, they should give you an idea of the time commitment you will need to reach your desired level of success given your level of preparedness.

<h3>Manage Your Time</h3>
Your time and the time of your teammates is valuable. You will want to manage your time well. There is no suggested order for learning the technical topics in this course. You should put together a personal and team schedule that allows you to get to a fluency level of 'disagree' in the <a href="">course rubric</a> by the end of week 8.</p>
<p>
Because the assessment items in the 'Code Topics Group' and the 'UML Diagrams and Tests Group' total to more than eight, you will not be able to plan to learn one topic a week. Plan ahead.
</p>
<p>
While there is no required or suggested order for you and your team to learn the topics, here is an order that other students have suggested might be good for you. Remember, this doesn't mean one topic per week. All of these are discussed in the book, but you may also need to go online to find more resources after you've read the book or look in the gitHub download for examples of the UML diagrams and documents. Online resources won't be helpful with learning the UML for this course.
<ol>
	<li>Java Collections</li>
	<li>Threads, Executors, and Runnables</li>
	<li>Application Controller Pattern</li>
	<li>MVC</li>
	<li>JavaBeans</li>
	<li>Hibernate</li>
	<li>QCJSON and JSON</li>
	<li>Android HttpUrlConnection</li>
	<li>Servlets</li>
	<li>JUnit Tests</li>
	<li>System Level Tests</li>
	<li>Use Case Diagrams</li>
	<li>Use Case Documents</li>
	<li>State Diagrams</li>
	<li>Sequence Diagrams</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hmmm...8 weeks and 15 topics. Plan well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:)
