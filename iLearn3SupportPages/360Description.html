<h1 class="centered">Object Oriented Software Development</h1>
<h2>This is not a Programming Course</h2>
<p>Software development is a process. It has different parts that interact as software is produced. The parts are Think, Design, Create Tests, Create Solution, Ship, Repeat. This course focuses on the first four software development parts.</p>
<p>The Think part of software development resolves some basic questions. They are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the problem?</li>
  <li>What are some potential code-level solutions to the problem? (brainstorming)</li>
  <li>What do I need to learn to code a solution to the problem?</li>
  <li>When will I learn what I need to know?</li>
  <li>How will I learn what I need to know?</li>
  <li>What resources for learning do I have?</li>
  <li>Learn what I need to know. (<a href="#sandboxing">Sandboxing</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>In a programming course, answers to questions 1 – 6 are pre-defined by the course designer. This means that creators of programming courses hope the students focus heavily on item 7. Can you see why this is not a programming course now? We haven't even talked about the Design, Create Tests, or Create Solution steps yet.
</p>
<p>As a part of this class you will learn about mobile user interface design, be introduced to Android development, and learn more about existing libraries and the functionality they make available to you. As you can see from even the list of the 7 parts of the Think step, this course is much more than just that. It is a course about learning these new programming things as part of a software development process experience.
</p>
<h2>This is not an Android Programming Course</h2>
<p>You will be exposed to Android development tools, explore mobile user interface design, and learn about a few of the user interface elements and user interactions the Android API makes available, but there is no in-depth study of those topics. There are many on-line courses, videos, and blog postings that do a good job covering those topics if you are interested.
</p>
<h2>So What is this Course?</h2>
<p>This course is designed to help you learn about software development and software development processes.  It is designed to allow you to experience education as described by Elder Kerr.
</p>
<p><span class="bookTitle">Elder Kerr, October 8, 2013 devotional</span> – "I ho"e to have communicated to you the importance of viewing learning as a progressive process—that we not just learn ‘about’ something, but that we learn ‘from’ it—that learning is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is all about becoming the people we ought to be.”
</p>
<p>In this class, you will be assessed on and given feedback regarding how well you are accomplishing Elder Kerr's definition of learning. You will also be assessed on your teamwork skills and your professionalism. You can see how you will be assess for these outcomes by looking at the class rubric. The rubric also includes how you will be assessed regarding your fluency in the technical portions of the class.
</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you career will be writing software, designing networks, designing databases, working as a project manager, or working in any other part of IT, you can use what you learn in this class. The software development processes' parts are not unique to software development. Professionalism is not unique to software development. Learning is not unique to software development. All of these are used in everything human beings do to create anything meaningful such as music, art, buildings, highways, computer networks, or software.
</p>
<p>The development process is:
</p>
<ol id="thinkList">
  <li><b>Think,</b></li>
  <li><b>Design,</b></li>
  <li><b>Create Tests, and</b></li>
  <li><b>Create Solution.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Humanity has learned over and over that it is vital to do the steps in order. Each of them gives us the information we need to complete the next part.  Using this process will decrease the amount of time you spend working on a solution. I know...I know. It sounds like it will take longer but it doesn't. People have tried other ways in every industry including computing and anything else is slower and increases the amount of work required to create anything of worth. (Compare this with Abraham 4:1 - 5:9)

<h2>Advice From a Former Student</h2>
<p>
Dear Class of Next Semester,

Congratulations on getting this far in the degree! If you are in this class you are probably close to graduating, and if you are graduating, you are just like me last semester. The reason I'm writing you this letter is so you can learn from my mistakes, and from my successes.

You have no idea what you just got yourselves into. Like really, no idea! This class is nothing like you have ever taken because this is a job and not a class. Really, this is step 1 for being successful, <span class="bookTitle">treat this class like a job and not like a class</span>. There are no lectures on the job, there is no "help" (outside of your team) while on the job, you will have interviews with your "manager" like on the job, there are going to be deadlines like on the job, and if <span class="bookTitle">you do not work, you will be fired</span> like on the job (aka you will fail if you don’t work). This is something I wish I knew, and took <span class="bookTitle">very seriously</span>, when I first started the class. But, through all of this fear, there is a method to the teacher's madness (and it is madness). You will learn so much about developing software, and what it takes to be successful in that environment.

Before I get too deep in this letter, I want to tell you about me. I freakin’ hate programming. Like really really bad. The only real reason I passed my Java Programming class was because of what I remembered in my C++ Programming class I took earlier. I was not looking forward to this class because of my lack of skill and interest in programming (I want to go into Networking). Some of you are like this right now, and that is okay. <span class="bookTitle">You can get through this class!</span> It will be very hard, and take a lot of effort, but you can, and will, get through this class.

I was very stubborn when this class first started. I was close to graduating, hated programming, and just wanted to ride my teammate’s backs to get out of the class. I was struggling, and not focusing on anything that we were doing. I didn’t want to do anything. My grade, which was in the teens (that is an F) showed that. I could not go on like this for obvious reasons (I needed to graduate). <span class="bookTitle">If at any point </span> in the semester you feel like this, which many of you might, you need to have a "come"to Jesus” meeting. The sooner the better! This is what I did. I had my meeting, and opened up to new ideas on programming. Here are some helpful hints for this class that I wish I had known at the beginning of the class:
<ol>
  <li>Programming is fun when you see what you are doing – One turning point for me, was when we got the Android emulators running on our computers. What we were doing in class instantly became real. I had the thought, "This is what real programmers do." I could see the guy who made Flappy Bird working just like I was. Same with the guys who made Angry Birds, 2048, Chess, and every other application. When this happened, I was motivated to do more, and it became <span class="bookTitle">FUN.</span></li>
  <li>Team, team, team! – Your team will make or break this class. Find people who you know will do their work and put effort into this class. Meet with your team, plan out what you will teach each other, and learn from each other! If you do not have a strong team, this class will get very hard, very fast. To start this class this semester, you automatically have 1 person on your team, <span class="bookTitle">YOUR TEACHER</span>. Talk with your teacher about your thoughts, problems, and questions <span class="bookTitle">IN CLASS!!!!</span> (or if you are an online student as part of your Google+ group). Think of your teacher as that teammate who shows up to class, knows everything, but doesn’t do any of your work for you. They help you help yourself to pass this class.</li>
  <li><span class="bookTitle">DO NOT</span> procrastinate. If you slack off in this class, you are playing a dangerous game.</li>
</ol>
You guys can do great things if you work hard. At the end of this class, I liked programming and I actually plan to go on to make my application for real! I hated this class at the start, and still don’t like it at the end, but I learned to appreciate the class, method, and journey that this class offered me. Good luck!
