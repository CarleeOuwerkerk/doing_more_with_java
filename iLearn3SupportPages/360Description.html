<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Object Oriented Software Development</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>This is not a programming course.</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Software development is a process. It has different parts that interact as software is produced. The parts are Think, Design, Create Tests, Create Solution, Ship, Repeat. This course focuses on the first four software development parts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Think part of software development resolves some basic questions. They are:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">What is the problem?</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">What are some potential code-level solutions to the problem? (brainstorming)</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">What do I need to learn to code a solution to the problem?</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">When will I learn what I need to know?</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">How will I learn what I need to know?</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">What resources for learning do I have?</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">Learn what I need to know. (Sandboxing)</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a programming course, answers to questions 1 – 6 are pre-defined by the people who designed the course. This means that creators of programming courses hope the students focus heavily on item 7. Can you see why this is not a programming course now? We haven't even talked about the Design, Create Tests, or Create Solution steps yet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As a part of this class you will learn about mobile user interface design, be introduced to Android development, and learn more about existing libraries and the functionality they make available to you. As you can see from even the list of the 7 parts of the Think step, this course is much more than just that. It is a course about learning these new programming things as part of a software development process experience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>This is not an Android programming course.</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You will be exposed to Android development tools, explore mobile user interface design, and learn about a few of the user interface elements and user interactions the Android API makes available, but there is no in-depth study of those topics. There are many on-line courses, videos, and blog postings that do a good job covering those topics if you are interested.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>So what is this course?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This course is designed to help you learn about software development and software development processes.  It is designed to allow you to experience education as described by Elder Kerr.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b><i>Elder Kerr, October 8, 2013 devotional</i> – “I hope to have communicated to you the importance of viewing learning as a progressive process —that we not just learn ‘about’ something, but that we learn ‘from’ it—that learning is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is all about becoming the people we ought to be.”</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You will be assessed on and given feedback regarding how well you are accomplishing Elder Kerr's definition of learning. You will also be assessed on your teamwork skills and your professionalism. You can see how you will be assess for these outcomes by looking at the rubric for these assessments. The rubric also includes how you will be assessed regarding your fluency in the technical portions of the class.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It doesn’t matter if you career will be writing software, designing networks, designing databases, working as a project manager, or working in any other part of IT, you can use what you learn in this class. The software development processes parts are not unique to software development. Professionalism is not unique to software development. Learning is not unique to software development. All of these are used in everything human beings do to create meaningful, quality components and systems. Human beings use the Think, Design, Create Tests, Create Solution process when we build anything of worth from music and art to buildings, highways, computer networks, or software.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Again, the development process is:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li6"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Think,</b></span></li>
  <li class="li6"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Design,</b></span></li>
  <li class="li6"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Create Tests, and</b></span></li>
  <li class="li6"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Create Solution.</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Humanity has learned over and over that it is vital to do the steps in order. Each of them gives us the information we need to complete the next part.  Using this process will decrease the amount of time you spend working on a solution. I know...I know. It sounds like it will take longer but it doesn't. People have tried other ways in every industry including computing and anything else is slower and increases the amount of work required to create anything of worth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Some Definitions:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sandboxing</b> – the process of learning by exploring how an object, method, function, or a programming construct works by playing with it outside of the solution you eventually will create. Playing with it consists of seeing how it works when used correctly and what happens when it is misused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
